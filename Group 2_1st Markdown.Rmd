## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Why do we need to study and analyze data? (Abel)

- Data when analysed and used can influenced a lot of things from a regular person everyday activities to that of a country's economy and government

- It can help the person improve their analytical skills which can be useful in some field

- Solution to a problem can originate from a unconventional or not expected way

- It can be used to backup or disprove arguments

- Make Informed Decisions

- Optimizations
