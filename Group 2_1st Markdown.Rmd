## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
1) Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data?

- Javier

	Data in essence is information grouped together in the form of statistics and graphs. Being able to analyze what the meaning is behind all of the numbers, means more knowledge in the topic the data pertains too. With this, people can make decisions to adapt to the information given. Without people with the skills in interpreting data correctly, the people who need it will take unguided actions, leading to mistakes and accidents in the future. 
	
2) Cite at least one instance or application where data science was used and contributed on policy-making, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.

  Data Science was used in helping governments to make proper policies to adapt to the pandemic. One specific instance is lifting certain restrictions of quarantine here in the Philippines. Due to the nature of the virus, the government had to take necessary action to limit human traffic, negatively affecting many businesses which in turn negatively affect the economy. Data/statistics on the state of the pandemic were constantly being updated monthly. With the help of some experts, the government deduced it was time to start allowing non-essential businesses to function to a limited degree.  Without data scientists, the government might have done this in a worse time, worsening the already dire situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  	
3) Propose atleast one data science topic that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical method you think you will need, and who would benefit this study.

  In the modern world, data mining is essential knowledge. We are in an age where information is large in quantity and widespread throughout the known world. To process this amount of data is what data mining does.Further innovations in to this field will help in making more accurate reads and analysis on data. Graphs can be a first step towards that venture. Perhaps looking into examples like histograms can help me improve on existing models or come up with new ones. However, there is still much research done from past data scientists for this particular field, which can help me in learning whatever needs to be known about it. Large companies will most likely benefit from this study.  They are often associated with a large amount of clientele and assets. There will be a huge amount of information that comes from this and there will be a demand for experts to sort this through.
  
## Why do we need to study and analyze data? (Abel)

- First of all it can help the person improve their analytical skills which can be useful in some field. It can also be
used to make informed decision, backed or disproved arguments or optimization that will improve something.But the most
important thing on why we need to study and analyze datais that data when can be used to influenced a lot of things from
a regular person everyday activities to that of a country's economy and government.

## One instance or application where data science was used.

    It can be used in business where it can help the company save money. An example of this is the Network Planning Tool
that UPS created to be able to optimize package transport from drop-off to delivery. They does this by using machine
learning and AI to simulate a variety of routes and the program will pick the best ones. According to a company forecast,
the platform could save UPS 100 to 200 million.


     Not only it can be use to save money, companies can also used it to be able to have the maximum profit. This is most
prevalent online where a lot of data and statistics are used to determine what kind of advertisment that will be shown
and how to retain the most amount of time. This is shown in popular websites like Google, Youtube, Facebook.

    Another field in which it can be used is in sports. One of this is RSPCT: BASKETBALL-COACHING SENSOR that the is
being use in NBA. RSPCT’s shooting analysis system tracked and record when and where the ball strikes on each basket
attempt by using sensor on a basketball hoop’s rim. It funnels that data to a device that displays shot details in real
time and generates predictive insights.


## Proposal

    A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation via text or text-to-speech instead of
a human. I chose this because of how prevalent chatbots arein todays society and how customizable it is. It can be used
to help us in alot of things like automating tasks, act as a communication medium and to even use as a mean to play
games. 

     Since a chatbot is very customizable to whatever the programmer's goal, there are many kinds data that can be used
into making the bot. Even if there are not that many data available, the more people uses and input information into the
bot it itself can be the source of data into which it can improve on. Some of the statistical method that can be use are
surveys which can be use to improve the bot, cluster sampling and Sample Size Determination to have a data on which the
bot will be exposed to and Regression to determining trends over time, connections that which will help the bot not be
outdated and up to date with whats happening with the world. This will benefit alot of people and many companies as. As a
good chatbot will optimize and automate alot of things that can save time and resources for both people and the company.

## Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data? (tricia)
Data is meaningless unless it can be converted into valuable information, which is why it is necessary to study and 
analyze data. Data science enables one’s questions/ queries to be answered through the information provided by the organized/ 
statistically-analyzed data, leading one to make data-driven decisions/ solutions or even predictions. For businesses and 
organizations, a data-driven approach means companies examine and organize their data leading to better service to their 
consumers. Making sense of data can lead to saving money, effective marketing and more efficient operations
 
There is also a  need to study data as data science is becoming more important in almost every field. Since data about 
almost everything is available on the web, data analysis can be applied to various fields. Therefore, learning how to 
analyze data can increase one’s job opportunities.

## Cite at least one instance or application where data science was used and contributed on policy-making, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.
 
Policy making - Data and the ability to quickly process them makes way for a government to be more responsive. Knowing 
that a problem exists is frequently not enough, it is also important to know what are the factors that affect this problem 
and how they interact with each other and this can be known through data and its analysis. Having this knowledge can help 
which things to consider in policy making. For instance, in a report on the possibility of a terrorist attack on drinking 
water supplies, the Government Accountability Office noted that experts consulted “most strongly supported developing 
real-time monitoring technologies to quickly detect contaminants in treated drinking water on its way to consumers.”

market trends - Netflix, which is one of the biggest streaming platforms as of now, makes use of data science/ analytics, 
which played a role in the company’s success. From their 150 million subscribers, Netflix gathers data regarding their consumer’s 
watching information such as the time and date a user watched a show, the device used, when the show was paused, when 
it was resumed, shows that were finished, searches, recommendations and others. This data, along with the use of analytic 
tools, allows Netflix to know the current market trends which can be used in making future decisions/ releases. This decides 
which original contents/ shows will be greenlit. 

## Propose at least one data science topic that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical methods you think you will need, and who would benefit from this study.

A data science topic that I would like to pursue would be data visualization. It involves the presentation of data in a 
graphical format making it easier for viewers to understand the content and see the important patterns and trends. This 
requires the usage of different types of graphs such as line graphs, bar graphs, box and whiskers plots etc. 

A specific study that can be done with this data science topic is generating word clouds based on transcripts of Filipino 
presidential candidates. Of course, the Filipino citizens would benefit from this study because it can help them learn a 
little bit more about the candidates through simple visualizations.
